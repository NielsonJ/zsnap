On WINDOWS
==========

1. Install Panda3d-1.8.0-forSNAP-win32.exe. You should  find it at:
   ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/software/SNAP/

2. Extract the SNAP distribution.
   You should be able to run the SNAP launcher.py now (by double-clicking it on 
   Windows or making a shortcut with additional command-line arguments). 
   
   If you are being asked to select a program to open the file with, you may pick 
   C:\Panda3d-1.8.0\python\python.exe For possible arguments, see launcher.py. 
   You can also drag the .py file onto your python.exe to run it. If you would force
   this to be your default Python installation you can also install Python 2.7.2 "over" 
   it by installing it to the location C:\Panda3d-1.8.0\python\ instead of the default
   C:\Python27. Do not forget that you need to uninstall Python and Panda in reverse order
   later.

   If you make a shortcut with the launcher.py file on the Desktop and append some 
   arguments you may have to modify the command line in the shortcut to look as follows:
   python "C:\mystuff\SNAP\launcher.py" -m MyModule
   (i.e., prepend python at the beginning, or C:\Panda3d-1.8.0\python\python.exe if
   you have multiple Pythons around).
   
   You can add new modules by putting a new code file in the modules directory
   (see modules\MAKING A MODULE.TXT). You can set up new studies (which is a way
   to organize content, e.g. media files, at study granularity by creating a
   sub-directory in the studies directory (see studies\MAKING A STUDY.TXT).

3. Set up the editor and development environment.
   In the folder where you installed Panda3d you find under the sub-directory 
   python/eclipse a reasonable Python editor (eclipse.exe). It is fairly usable
   but also quite clunky and complicated -- a good alternative is PyCharm (free for
   Academia and open-source projects); if you would like to use this instead, skip
   to the paragraph that starts with PyCharm).
      
   3.1. Eclipse) To import your current SNAP copy into the eclipse workspace, do the following:
   - Right-click the Project Explorer panel and choose Import...
   - Select General / Existing Projects into Workspace
   - Under Select root directory, choose the SNAP folder
   - Then under Projects: check SNAP (if not already checked) and click OK; 
     SNAP should now be imported.
   - you may be prompted to have your Python interpreter auto-configured. For this,
     click on Auto-config, when asked select your Panda3d-1.8.0/python/python.exe file
	 and otherwise click OK.

   If you don't have a green "Play" button in your Eclipse toolbar, you
   need to tell Eclipse (once) to auto-detect the Python interpreter:
   - In the main window, go to Window / Preferences
   - Expand Pydev, select Interpreter - Python, and click Auto Config and OK
   - Windows only: In the list below, add a folder by clicking on New Folder;
     your\path\to\Panda3d-1.8.0\bin

   To debug or run SNAP from within the IDE, right-click in the Project Explorer
   on the SNAP/src/launcher.py file, select Debug as / Python Run. After the
   first-time launch, you find a green round playback icon right under the
   source code panel, which lets you re-execute the previous configuration.
   
   By default this will just start the sample experiment; to customize the 
   command-line arguments used for startup, select "Run Configurations..."
   duplicate the one that is already pre-defined, and append to the arguments
   some combination of command line arguments as explained in the beginning 
   of launcher.py.
  
  
   3.2. PyCharm) After you have installed PyCharm, click "Open Directory" and point it to 
   your SNAP folder. Then right-click the launcher.py and select Run "launcher - defaults".
   You may be asked to select your Python Interpreter first. To do this:
   - Go to File / Settings / Project / Python Interpreter and click Configure Interpreter.
   - Click The add button (a plus) next to the upper list box
   - select the C:\Panda3d-1.8.0\python\python.exe file (or wherever you installed Panda)
   - after you have clicked okay it will take a while to read the directory and after that
     it will take another while until the wait bar at the bottom of the editor finishes
     (it says "Indexing..." next to it).
   - once the indexing is completed (a one-time thing) you can select the configuration to 
     run in the pull-down bar next to the green play button (triangle) and then it the 
     play button. To debug your code, click the button with the bug. See documentation.


On MacOS
========

1. Download the Panda3d 1.8.0 Installer for MacOS from:
   http://www.panda3d.org/download.php?platform=macosx&version=1.8.0&sdk
   and execute it.

2. Download SNAP 1.02 (or later) from ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/SNAP/
   and extract the archive.

3. Run the file launcher.py (in the SNAP/src sub-directory) to launch SNAP. By default
   this should bring up one of the basic sample experiments. Confirm that a window is
   opened with grey background which displays some black text (etc.) in the center.

   If you get no such window, try to open a Terminal window and cd into the SNAP/src
   directory. Then enter:
   python launcher.py

   This should now bring up the window -- if not then most likely your default python
   distribution on Mac does not coincide with the one to which Panda3d added its own packages
   (perhaps your MacOS version is too new or you have a non-default Python distribution installed).
   The best way to proceed is to find the Sample Programs that were installed with Panda
   (see the www.panda3d.org documentation on where to find them if you can't seem to find them
   in any obvious location) and to make sure that these programs run correctly (likely there is
   a shortcut or shell script for each of them). Once you have confirmed that, start the launcher.py
   in the same way as these sample programs are being started. To switch the experiment module that
   is being loaded, see documentation in launcher.py and the file LEARNING SNAP.txt (which should be
   your next file to read).

4. Install a Python development environment of your liking. We recommend using PyCharm
   (http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/index.html), which is a quite nice and simple IDE with
   good debugging features. Once installed, you should be able to open the SNAP directory and run the
   launcher. One of the neat features of PyCharm, if you're frequently switching between experiment
   modules, is the "Run Configuration" pull-down menu in the toolbar -- this allows you to select and
   define run configurations (i.e., run SNAP with a different experiment module, parameters, etc. than
   default) quite easily. See the file LEARNING SNAP.txt and the documentation of the launcher.py and
   to understand how SNAP is set up and what the parameters to launcher.py mean.
